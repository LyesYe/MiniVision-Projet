# MiniVision-Projet
 
The goal of this project is to realize a mini-compiler going through the different phases of 
compilation, namely the lexical analysis using the FLEX tool and the syntax-semantic analysis using the
semantic analysis using the BISON tool. The generation of the intermediate code, the optimization as well as 
and the generation of the machine code will be done in C language.  


The parallel treatments concerning the management of the table of the symbols as well as the treatment of the various 
processing of the various errors must also be carried out during the analysis phases of the 
compilation process.
